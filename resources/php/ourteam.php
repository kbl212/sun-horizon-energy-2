                <p>15 years of operations, sales, management, training and architectural design experience, but his true passion is creating businesses and systems that work. Before merging with Sun Horizon Energy, Andrew was just simply a stud, everything he touches turns to gold. Now overseeing installation operations, Andrew is responsible for creating and improving the systems used to ensure that every detail is ready before PV panels ever get installed. If there is a snag that occurs in the process from sale to installation, it is his responsibility to rectify it and get the job going again. And he has an infectious smile.

                <h5>Roger Rougelot, General Contractor</h5>

                <p>A contractor for over 20 years. He began his career as a framer and then honed his skills as a finish carpenter. After college Roger was drafted by the Winnipeg Jets to play professional hockey. Following a successful career Roger decided to continue doing what he knew how to do…play with sticks. In addition to building, Roger also began designing and drafting homes. The combination of his experience and drive led Mr. Rougelot to start his own a general contractor firm in 2001. Before joining with Sun Horizon Energy, Roger built and remodeled dozens of homes throughout the Wasatch Front. Now, as the general contractor and quality control operator for Sun Horizon Energy, that same attention to detail that went into running remodeling projects is perfectly suited for the tight and meticulous details that accompany PV system prep work and installation. </p>

                <p>Every company needs a Kevin, not every company has a Kevin on their staff. Before co-founding the real estate firm KMAK Group in 2009 with Andrew Kent, Mr. Moss was a top producing real estate agent at one of the largest brokerages in the region. Mr. Moss excels when it comes to negotiations and client advocacy. Nothing is more important to him than happy solar clients. Nothing! As a motivator and instructor, Kevin is second to none. He has shared his expertise in contract negotiations, lead generation and closing skills with real estate brokerages across the state. Kevin also lends a unique talent to the company’s abilities, as he is bi-lingual, speaking English and Spanish fluently. To say that Kevin is loved and admired by everyone he meets is not overstated, he is simply the best person to have on any staff, we are lucky to have this Ace on our staff.</p>
