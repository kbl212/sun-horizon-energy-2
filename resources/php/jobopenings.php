        <h2><strong>Why work at Sun Horizon Energy?</strong></h2>

        <h2><strong>At SHE we believe that we are the best company to work for, period. We don't mess around in making this statement and backing up this statement with facts. How are we the best?</strong></h2>
        
        <br>

        <p>1. Nothing we do here is about us, it's all about the families that will be buying solar from us. We are going to make their homes better and we are going to save them money. The deal is always going to benefit the homeowner first, before SHE benefits. </p>

        <p>2. We will provide exceptional service, we won't pass "the buck around", we will take responsibility when we have to and we will lead by example, from the top to the very newest employee walking through our doors. </p>

        <p>3. We will look out for our industry and be good stewarts over it. We will be first to point out areas for improvement, we will offer free informative webinars to our customers and help local government officials in learning about the benefits of solar homes, so that laws can be passed to protect each and every one of us. </p>

        <br>
        <h4><strong>Our Culture</strong></h4>

        <p>We will be the toast of the town. While we won't seek and publish our "best company to work for" accomplishments, we are the best company to work for in the state of Utah. Why? Because that will be our culture. Everything will do will be to recognize our employees, promote diversity, create many different styles of leadership, learn and appreciate different cultures, religions, styles of doing business, all of which will make us an enviable place to call home. Applying to work with us means that you are ready to join the best team ever assembled in Utah, and we mean every word of that statement.</p>
