        <h2>GET STARTED WITH A FREE CONSULTATION AND HOME EVALUATION</h2>
        <br>
        <p>We have developed an easy way for all homeowners to inquiry if they qualify. Before filling out the simple questions below, here is some useful information for you to consider:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Do I qualify?</strong></p>
        <p>RESPONSE: Not everyone qualifies for solar. Meaning, some households may not qualify for solar based on the conditions of their current roof (we will evaluate that for you), the location of your home (how much sunlight your home receives)</p>
        <p><strong>Not every homeowner can qualify for financing.</strong></p>
        <p>RESPONSE: While we offer many options for those homeowners who wish to finance their solar installation, some homeowners may not qualify for financing. The good news is that most solar financing is geared towards specifically addressing the benefit of solar and will consider other factors that traditional lending does not take into account. For example, eliminating a large percentage of your energy bill per month.</p>
        <p><strong>What does the process to getting started look like?</strong></p>
        <p>RESPONSE: The first step with every customer is to evaluate your current energy consumption. We do this by simply evaluating your most recent utility bill. Second, we will research your home and via google earth, for example, to determine the position of your home, with respect to direct sun contact and establish a soft evaluation on moving forward. We will then design a system for your home, based on historically usage. This free design is then presented to the homeowner. Following this free consultation, we move directly to a site survey, whereby, one of our trained site surveyors will go to a customer's home and evaluate the site for installation. Once a site survey is performed, we will then contact the homeowner and present the results. Upon acceptance of these results, we initiate "SolarGo"tm we pull permits from the city, purchase all equipment and secure an installation date. </p>
